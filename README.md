## About the project

I've developed this game using **Unreal Engine** 4.27 and **C++** using the following capabilities - 

* General Functionalities - 
  - Player inputs, character movement manipulation, adding character sockets for equipping weaponry.
  - Exposing properties to Blueprints, Timers, Blueprint native events, Blueprint callable and pure functions.
  - Pausing the game, and level change called on completion.

* Unreal Motion Graphics UI Design (UMG) - 
  - Health, stamina, dynamic health bars, and various game event prompts.

* Mathematical concepts - 
  - Interpolation, Randomization, Vector computations such as Dot and Cross products.
  - Vectors, Arrays, Maps.

* Collisions -
  - Creating collision for game objects.
  - Manipulating character and actor collisions.
  - Disabling and enabling collision based on animation timing (Anim Notifies).

* Animation - 
  - Animation instances, animation blueprints, montages, notifies, and timelines.

* Artificial intelligence (AI) -
  - Used AIControllers and Nav Mesh Bound Volumes to create intelligent enemies.

* Game optimization - 
  - Refactored the code, minimized function calls, passing values to functions by reference to avoid copies.
  - Used interfaces and inheritance to avoid redundant code.
  - Used dynamic arrays wherever necessary and Unreal's reflection system to participate in garbage collection
